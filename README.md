### Key Features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to store high scores and display them
- Ability to take mouse input and move pong board
- Ability for CPU to see the ball and hit it back

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. 4 HTML pages. One for login, one for game play, one for about page, one for high scores.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login and game play interaction from user.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
- **DB/Login** - stores users and scores.
- **WebSocket** - High scores are broadcast to all other users.
